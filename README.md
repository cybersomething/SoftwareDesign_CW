# CMP102 - Software Design

If you're using this for your First Year coursework, use this as a guide as you'll get caught out for plagirism and that's not a good look for you :) 

I was awarded a B overall for this unit. I found the C++ in Easy Steps book, a really helpful guide when writing this - so if you're like me and find C++ kinda difficult, definitely look into it!
